\title{Get Perturbation Support}
\usage{
get_perturb_support(cell_state_graph, perturb_table, gene_expr, gene_target)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_state_graph}{An object representing the cell state graph, containing nodes and edges.}

\item{perturb_table}{A data frame containing perturbation information, including cell groups, delta log abundance, and delta q-values.}

\item{gene_expr}{A data frame containing gene expression data, including gene names, cell states, and expression levels.}

\item{gene_target}{A string representing the target gene(s), separated by semicolons, commas, or hyphens.}
}
\value{
A data frame with edges annotated with the type of support ("direct support", "indirect support", or NA) and the target gene.
}
\description{
This function calculates the support for perturbations in a cell state graph based on perturbation data, gene expression, and target genes.
}
\details{
The function evaluates the support for perturbations by checking changes in abundance, expression levels, and parent node states. It distinguishes between direct and indirect support based on parent node changes.

# Example usage:
result <- get_perturb_support(cell_state_graph, perturb_table, gene_expr, "geneA;geneB")
