\title{Connect Isolated Nodes in a Graph}
\usage{
connect_isolated_nodes(G, node_metadata)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{An igraph object representing the graph.}

\item{node_metadata}{A data frame containing node metadata. It must have columns "id" and "group_nodes_by".}
}
\value{
An igraph object with isolated nodes connected within each group.
}
\description{
This function takes a graph and node metadata, and connects isolated nodes within each group specified in the metadata.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Checks if the node metadata contains the required columns "id" and "group_nodes_by".
\item Creates a mapping from node id to group.
\item Iterates over each group and identifies isolated nodes within the group.
\item Connects isolated nodes in a grid-like structure within each group.
}
}

\dontrun{
library(igraph)

# Create a sample graph
G <- make_empty_graph(n = 10, directed = FALSE)

# Create sample node metadata
node_metadata <- data.frame(
  id = 1:10,
  group_nodes_by = rep(1:2, each = 5)
)

# Connect isolated nodes
G_aug <- connect_isolated_nodes(G, node_metadata)

# Plot the augmented graph
plot(G_aug)
}
