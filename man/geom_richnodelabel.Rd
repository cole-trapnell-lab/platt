\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{aes()} or \code{aes_()}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three options:
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot data as specified in the call to \code{ggplot()}.
\item A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See \code{fortify()} for which variables will be created.
\item A \code{function} will be called with a single argument, the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and will be used as the layer data.
}}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{layer()}. These are often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like \code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{parse}{If \code{TRUE}, the labels will be parsed into expressions and displayed as described in \code{?plotmath}.}

\item{nudge_x}{Horizontal adjustment to nudge labels by. Useful for offsetting text from points, particularly on discrete scales.}

\item{nudge_y}{Vertical adjustment to nudge labels by. Useful for offsetting text from points, particularly on discrete scales.}

\item{label.padding}{Amount of padding around label. Defaults to \code{unit(0.25, "lines")}.}

\item{label.r}{Radius of rounded corners. Defaults to \code{unit(0.15, "lines")}.}

\item{label.size}{Size of label border. Defaults to \code{0.25}.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? \code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default plot specification, e.g. \code{borders()}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer that can be added to a ggplot object.
}
\description{
This function creates a custom ggplot2 layer for rich text node labels in network plots.
